# Hello this is my second About Me page but made with markdown! 
## my name is Matthew Valencia and I am a student at UW studying computer science

Here are some more **fun facts** about me: 
* I was born and raised in Spokane WA and never moved houses
* I have two dogs one named Rocky and the other named Ruby
* I have one older sister. We are 5 years a part but I have *stolen* lots of her personality quirks so we are pretty alike
